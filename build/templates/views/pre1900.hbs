              <h1>The first European nurses: the Grey Nuns Come to Alberta</h1>

              <p>The only concession they made to the climate and the terrain was that they wore moccasins under their
                habits. They walked beside the oxen for fifty-two days, from St. Boniface to Lac Ste. Anne, fifty miles
                beyond Edmonton--a journey that today takes twelve hours by train.

                It was 1859 and a call had gone out from the mission at Lac Ste. Anne for Grey Nuns to come and begin
                missionary and hospital work among the Indians. Indian medicine still held sway in Rupert's Land.
                Midwifery, "summer complaints" and war wounds were all treated with herbs and plants, methods handed
                down from generation to generation. However, 1859 was also the year that Florence Nightingale published
                her Notes on Nursing, designed mostly to help mothers of sick children. It was a departure from what was
                usually understood of the term “nursing.” Change was on the way.

                More Grey Nuns arrived in Rupert's Land in 1862, this time in St. Albert, and had soon built a hospital,
                an orphanage and a school. Less than ten years later they were dealing with a smallpox epidemic that
                decimated the community and the surrounding aboriginal communities - two thirds of the population caught
                the disease and half of those who were infected died. The following year a Board of Health was set up
                for the new North West Territories (no longer Rupert's Land) and, with the arrival in Fort Macleod of
                the North West Mounted Police the first lay hospital was established in 1874.

                These early nurses didn't just nurse--they ran orphanages, they taught school, they kept a very
                important garden, and, in between all the other jobs, they cleaned all of the buildings. In Fort
                Chipewyan where they arrived in 1874, three sisters lived on the second floor of the shed that also
                housed the school, where they and the volunteer worker took turns sleeping on one pallet. They still did
                all the work of nursing, teaching and providing food for their charges. The Grey Nuns continued to serve
                the community of Fort Chipewyan until 1993.</p>

              <h2>Nurses pioneered in Alberta</h2>
              <p>Nurses played a major role in setting up the first hospitals in the province and by the time Alberta
                became a province in 1905 many nurses were working in all communities from north to south. Nursing has
                had a glorious history of helping to build the province and care for its citizens ever since.

                The first health agency in the province was the hospital-school-orphanage that the Grey Nuns built in
                St. Albert in 1870. The three Grey Nuns sisters had come to the province at the request of Father
                Lacombe in 1859. Another early hospital was the so-called police hospital in 1874 at the Northwest
                Mounted Police post at Fort Macleod.

                Alberta's first lay nurse, Miss Mary Newton, arrived at Hermitage near Edmonton in the late 1880s. In
                1891 she was advertising that she was prepared to do nursing and midwifery in homes for the fee of ten
                dollars per week. A graduate of one of the new nursing schools in London, England, Miss Newton worked
                partly under her association with the Anglican church.

                In 1890 Calgary saw the establishment of both the Calgary General Hospital and the Holy Cross Hospital.
                The Galt Hospital in Lethbridge was opened about the same time, as was the Medicine Hat General, with
                Miss Grace Reynolds as the Matron and Miss Mary Ellen Birtles as her assistant. The Victorian Order of
                Nurses after the turn of the century helped to establish small "cottage hospitals" like those named
                after Lady Minto in Red Deer, Islay and Edson.

                With the arrival of the CPR, growth came quickly and physicians arrived to care for the mine and railway
                employees. They opened hospitals and hired British-trained nurses. Hospitals were administered by a
                Matron who worked under an all-male board of directors.

                Many of the first hospitals were funded and administered by companies, like the Galt Hospital in
                Lethbridge which was operated by the Alberta Coal and Railway Company. For people who were not employees
                some hospitals charged fifty cents a day, if the person was able to pay. At the Grey Nuns hospital in
                Edmonton, they claimed that "never a pauper patient has been refused admittance."

                Nursing schools were opened just a few years later. Discipline for nurses was strict and included: "a
                professional spirit which includes a cheerful, willing obedience to authority." The young women were
                enjoined to: "at all times guard against anything that would bring dishonour to their school or their
                profession." Nursing was considered a good preparation for marriage and the students were paid very
                little, virtually volunteering their labour to the hospitals.

                By 1904 there were enough nurses in Calgary to form the Calgary Association of Graduate Nurses. In 1914
                they joined with the Edmonton group to become the Graduate Nurses Association of Alberta. They lobbied
                the government for professional status and in 1916 the Registered Nurses Act was passed establishing the
                Alberta Association of Graduate Nurses.</p>
